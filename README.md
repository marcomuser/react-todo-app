## About
In this learning project I build up a relatively uncomplicated to-do application. The frontend is created with React. State management I have implemented exclusively with React Hooks. Data fetching with the native fetch()-API. Furthermore, I used Express and Node.js to implement the backend as a REST API. MongoDB serves as database and Mongoose as ODM.

## Goal
The goal is a clean, simple and modern implementation of a fullstack app making use of a REST API with Express and a React frontend based on React Hooks.

## How to deploy on your computer
1. Fork this repository and clone it with git to your computer.
2. Run `npm install` in the main folder as well as in the client folder.
3. If MongoDB is not installed and running on your computer, you have to download, install and launch it first!
4. In your terminal, run `npm run dev` in the main folder to launch the backend and `npm start` in the client folder to launch the frontend.
5. The to-do app should automatically be opened in your default browser.
